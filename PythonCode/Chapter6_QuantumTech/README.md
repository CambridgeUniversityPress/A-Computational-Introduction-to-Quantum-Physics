Some of the scripts in this chapter reads input data from files. Specifically, this applies to Exercise_6_1_2_e.py, which reads the 
file Current.dat, and the files Exercise_6_2_2_a.py and Exercise_6_2_2_b.py, which reads the file Helium_S_L.dat.

Both these data files, which are ascii formatted, are found in this directory - along with the source code.
