"""This script simulates a spin 1/2-particle which is exposed to a magnetic 
field. This field has both  a static part and a dynamic part. The dynamic part 
oscillates in time as a sine function. The static field points in the 
z-direction, thus lifting the degenerecy between spin up and spin down. The 
oscillating field is taken to point along the x-axis, corresponding to a real 
coupling in the Hamiltonian.

The initial state is a spin up-state.

The implementation solves the Schr√∂dinger equation (TDSE) by using the 
SciPy function solve_ivp. It plots the  probability of a spin up-measurement 
as a function of time.

The inputs are
E     - the energy separation induced by the static field
Omega - the strength of the oscillating field
w     - the angular frequency of the oscillating field
OpticalCycles - the duration of the simulation, given by the number of 
periods of the oscillating field.

All inputs are hard coded initially.
