"""
This script simulates a spin 1/2-particle which is exposed to a magnetic 
field. It does so in two ways: 1) by direct, numerical solution of the 
Schroedinger equation (TDSE) and 2) approximatively by the analytical 
solution within the rotating wave approximation (RWA).

The magnetic field has both a static part and a dynamic part. The dynamic, 
which points along the x axis, part oscillates in time as a sine function. 
The static field points in the z-direction, thus lifting the degenerecy 
between spin up and spin down.

The initial state is a spin up-state.

The implementation solves the Schr√∂dinger equation by using the SciPy 
function solve_ivp. It plots the probability of a spin up-measurement as 
a function of time.

The inputs are
E     - the energy separation induced by the static field
Omega - the strength of the oscillating field
w     - the angular frequency of the oscillating field
OpticalCycles - the duration of the simulation, given
by the number of periods of the oscillating field.

All inputs are hard coded initially.
