"""
 This script determines the tunneling rate for a particle of unit mass 
 hitting a barrier supported in a finite interval.
 It solves the time-independent Schr√∂dinger equation in the region where 
 the potential is supported by formulating it as a first order coupled ODE 
 in \psi(x) and \phi(x), where \phi(x) = \psi'(x). 

 In this particular case, the potential is constant. This allows us to test 
 our implementation by comparing it to an analytical, exact solution.

 Inputs:
 V0 - The height of the potential
 D  - The width of the interval in which the potential 
 is nonzero
 E  - The energy of the particle, must be positive
 
 These input parameters are hard coded initially.
